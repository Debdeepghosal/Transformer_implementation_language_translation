# Transformer Implementation for Language Translation

This repository contains an implementation of the Transformer model for language translation tasks.

## Overview

The implementation is based on the Transformer architecture introduced in the paper ["Attention Is All You Need"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) by Vaswani et al. It showcases the Transformer model's functionality for language translation tasks.

## Features

- **Transformer Implementation**: Codebase demonstrating the core components of the Transformer model, including self-attention mechanisms and positional encodings.
  
- **Language Translation Example**: Example scripts and notebooks for language translation tasks using the Transformer model.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Debdeepghosal/Transformer_implementation_language_translation.git
    ```

2. Explore the implementation of the Transformer model and its components in the provided directories.

3. Utilize the provided scripts or notebooks to experiment with language translation tasks using the Transformer architecture.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributions are welcomed! Please feel free to submit issues, suggestions, or pull requests to improve the implementation, add features, or fix any bugs.

## Acknowledgments

- This project is inspired by the Transformer model proposed in the seminal paper by Vaswani et al.
- Special thanks to the open-source community for their valuable resources and contributions in the field of natural language processing.
